# `METADATA.json` File Specification

The `METADATA.json` file is a [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)-formatted metadata file that contains some information derived from the font files, and some information about the status of the fonts at Google Fonts. The file uses UTF-8 encoding, though it may also include backslashed Unicode characters in form of `\u00e1`. Below is an example `METADATA.json` file for [/ofl/abeezee](ofl/abeezee/METADATA.json): 

```

Below is a brief description of the most important top-level fields of `METADATA.json` (those which provide unique information which cannot otherwise be derived from the font files themselves). Each top-level field can only occur once in the file.

* `"license": "Apache2"`
* `"license": "OFL"`
* `"license": "UFL"`

### `visibility`

The visibility field determines the current release status of the font on Google Fonts. One of 3 possible values:

* `"visibility": "External"` — font available on Google Fonts (both website and API)
* `"visibility": "Sandbox"` — font will be available shortly on Google Fonts (being tested)
* `"visibility": "Internal"` — the font will be served by the Google Fonts API but is not listed on the Google Fonts website

### `category`

* `"category": "Serif"`

* `"category": "Handwriting"`
* `"category": "Monospace"`

### `dateAdded`

### `name`

The family name of the font as shown in the Google Fonts user interface. Example:

This info may differ from the designer info included inside the font files. 

### `fonts`

A list of entries which point to font files in each family, looking like this:

```
{
	"name": "ABeeZee",
	"postScriptName": "ABeeZee-Italic",
	"fullName": "ABeeZee Italic",
	"style": "italic",

	"filename": "ABeeZee-Italic.ttf",
	"copyright": "Copyright (c) 2011 by Anja Meiners, with Reserved Font Name 'ABeeZee'"

The info in this section is derived from the information included inside the font files.
