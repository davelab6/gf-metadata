# Google Fonts Files

This project contains the binary font files served by Google Fonts: http://www.google.com/fonts

The top level folders indicate the license of all files found within them.
Subfolders are named according to the family name of the fonts within. 

Each family subdirectory contains the  `.ttf` font files served by Google Fonts, plus a `METADATA.json` file with metadata for the family (see [spec](METADATA.md)), and a `DESCRIPTION.en_us.html` with a description of the family in US English.

Also [/designers](designers/profiles.csv) contains a list of the Google+ pages for the fonts' designers.

## A Note On Licensing

Each font family directory contains the appropriate license file for the fonts in that directory and the fonts files themselves also contain licensing and authorship metadata.

The fonts in the collection are available under one of three opensource licenses:

* [/ofl](ofl): *[SIL Open Font License, v1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL)* (most fonts)
* [/apache](apache): *[Apache 2 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)* (some fonts)
* [/ufl](ufl): *[Ubuntu font license](http://font.ubuntu.com/ufl/ubuntu-font-licence-1.0.txt)* (the Ubuntu fonts)

The SIL Open Font License has an option for copyright holders to include a Reserved Font Name requirement, please take care of this important detail.

## Source Files

Source files for each family are often available from the designer, or from https://github.com/googlefonts 

These fonts are usually the result of collaborative projects, where you are invited to discuss issues with the designers and even contribute to their on-going development.

When customising or remixing fonts, please do contact the designers to understand what they might need in order to include your improvements.

Most of all: Enjoy the fonts!
